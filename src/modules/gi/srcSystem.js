// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — the GISystem entry point.
//
// Plan §7: "GISystem grows one `backend === "split-rc"` branch that early-outs
// into `srcSystem`, not tentacles." This is that early-out. Everything SRC
// needs from the engine arrives through the four arguments below; everything
// GISystem needs from SRC is on the returned object. Neither knows anything
// else about the other, which is the only reason the Phase-2/3 work can grow
// underneath this without turning into a sweep through a 7,000-line file.
//
// ══ WHY THIS IS OPT-IN AND WILL STAY OPT-IN UNTIL PHASE 6 ══════════════════
//
// `__giSrcProbes` defaults OFF. The probe population produces no light — the
// diffuse indirect term is still absent (plan §12.8) — so switching it on today
// costs GPU time and changes nothing on screen. It is on the frame so a person
// can look at the gizmos and so `smoke:gi-gpu?src=1` can audit the bindings; it
// is off by default so the shipping build is byte-identical, which is what
// makes every existing probe's numbers still comparable.
//
// ══ THE ANCHOR, WHICH IS THE ONE THING HERE THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS ════════════
//
// Probe keys carry cell coordinates in 9 bits per axis, RELATIVE to a lattice
// anchor. At LOD 0 that window is ±256·s₀ — about ±128 m at the default s₀ —
// so an anchor pinned at the world origin makes every near-camera probe
// unrepresentable the moment the player walks 130 m away. `packProbeKey`
// returns EMPTY there, which is correct and silent: GI simply stops having
// probes, and the symptom is a scene that lights fine at spawn and goes flat
// after a walk.
//
// So the anchor follows the camera — but NOT per frame. Re-anchoring re-keys
// every probe, which retires every probe, which is precisely the binary
// per-frame flip R1 forbids. It happens when the camera has drifted past
// `REANCHOR_CHEBYSHEV` (64·s₀, comfortably inside the 254·s₀ the window
// actually allows) and not before.
//
// One property makes this cheap, and it is worth stating because it is not
// obvious from the code: `latticeOrigin(anchor, s) = round(anchor/s)·s` is
// ALWAYS a multiple of s, so every lattice is world-aligned regardless of where
// the anchor sits. **Re-anchoring never moves a probe.** It only renumbers it.
// The cost is a lost temporal history, not a spatial pop.
